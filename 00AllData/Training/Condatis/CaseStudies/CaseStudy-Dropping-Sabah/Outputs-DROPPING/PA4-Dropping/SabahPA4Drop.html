				<b>KEY RESULTS</b><br><br>
				<b>Summary of results.</b>

				<br>
				For this landscape of interest, the speed of movement of the modelled species changes from 2527.8304 before
				any habitat is dropped to 0.0000 once
				all 15569 additional habitat cells are lost.
				This represents a reduction in speed of 100.0000% with a loss of
				habitat of 15569 km<sup>2</sup>
				(93.32% of the total habitat area).
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Trajectory of dropping</b><br>
				<img src = 'SabahPA4Drop_dropping_trajectory.png' alt='Speed vs Dropping Stage' ><br>
				Fig. 1:	The speed, (inversely related to the time taken to cross from source to target), is plotted against the stage of dropping. 
				Here the dropping mode is <b>Number based</b>. (The dropping of habitat cells from the Prioritisation layer is performed 
				such that  an equal amount of cells are dropped per stage). Speed is expected to get slower when habitat is lost from the landscape, but notice how severely speed is lost at different stages. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Dropping Rank Map</b>
				<br>
				<img src = 'SabahPA4Drop_dropping_rank.png' alt='Dropping Rank Map' ><br>
				<br>
				Fig. 2: An illustration of the rank of each habitat cell in the dropping analysis,
				with each drop stage represented by a different colour on the ramp. 
				The source and target are labelled using <span style = "color:magenta"> MAGENTA &block;</span> and <span style = "color:cyan"> CYAN &block;</span> respectively. 
				Non-droppable habitat cells are coloured <span style= "color:limegreen"> &block; GREEN. </span>
				Lower-ranking cells were dropped earliest because they carried relatively little flow. Higher ranking cells were retained longer, and this implies that they are of higher priority. See table 1 for more information on the cells included in each rank.

				<br>
				<b>BACKGROUND RESULTS</b><br>
				Additional figures that enable further interrogation of wildlife movement in the landscape.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Loss of Speed</b><br>
				
				<img src = 'SabahPA4Drop_speed_loss.png' alt='Speed vs Dropping Stage' ><br>
				
				Fig. 3:	The reduction in the speed of movement of the species from source to target 
				with each stage of dropping is illustrated by the colour ramp, (note log scale).<br>
				The source and target are labelled using <span style = "color:magenta"> MAGENTA &block;</span> and <span style = "color:cyan"> CYAN &block;</span> respectively. 
				Non-droppable habitat cells are coloured <span style= "color:green"> GREEN &block;</span>.
				This is a spatial representation of the values in column 5 of Table 1, 
				Reduction per cell. Higher values mean that the loss of these cells was highly detrimental to the total speed achievable in the landscape, 
				and it implies these cells are of higher priority for connectivity. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Start Flow Map</b>
				<br>
				<img src = 'SabahPA4Drop_start_flow.png' alt='Start Flow Map'><br>
				<br>
				Fig. 4: The pattern of flow of individuals from source to target across the landscape
				before dropping is performed, i.e. with all habitat cells within the Prioritisation Layer 
				contributing to connectivity. Flow through each cell is represented by the colour ramp, (note log scale). 
				The source and target are labelled using <span style = "color:magenta">MAGENTA &block;</span> and <span style = "color:cyan">CYAN &block;</span> respectively. 
				Areas without habitat are grey, i.e. contain no data. 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				<b>End Flow Map</b>
				<br>
				<img src = 'SabahPA4Drop_end_flow.png' alt='End Flow Map' ><br>
				<br>
				Fig. 5:	The pattern of flow of individuals from source to target across the landscape 
				after dropping has been performed, i.e. with no habitat cells within the Prioritisation
				layer contributing to connectivity. Flow through each cell is represented by the colour ramp, (note log scale).
				The source and target are labelled using <span style = "color:magenta">MAGENTA &block;</span> and <span style = "color:cyan">CYAN &block; </span>respectively. 
				
				Cells that have been dropped are grey, as are areas that never contained habitat.
				
				

				<br>
				
				
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Progress of movement</b>
				<br>
				<img src = 'SabahPA4Drop_end_progress.png' alt='Speed vs Dropping Stage' ><br>
				Fig. 6:	The progress of movement from source to target is illustrated by the colour ramp.
				Bands of similar colour lie at a similar effective distance between the source and the target,
				e.g. a value of 50%, as demonstrated in the legend, represents the cells the species is expected to reach 
				within half of the total 'travel' time. The source and target are labelled 
				using <span style = "color:magenta">MAGENTA &block;</span> and <span style = "color:cyan">CYAN &block; </span>respectively.
